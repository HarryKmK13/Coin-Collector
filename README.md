# Build Your Own World

### About the Project
Build Your Own World (BYOW) is a tile-based adventure game developed as part of UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS 61B Spring 2025 Project 3. The game procedurally generates a unique world of rooms and hallways using a user-input seed. Players can explore the world using keyboard controls, collect coins, and save/load their progress at any point. The game focuses on software design, algorithmic thinking, object-oriented programming, and creativity.

This project was developed in Java, leveraging a custom graphics engine (TileEngine) to render the world and support interactivity.

### Algorithms
Creates hallways to connect all rooms on the game board. The algorithm connects rooms by finding the closest unconnected neighbor for each room. The algorithm uses `Stack` and `HashSet` to keep track of the connected rooms. It guarantees that all the rooms are at least **connected as a tree**. *It is possible that the rooms are connected as a graph*. 

A `PriorityQueue` was also used so that the algorithm runs from the leftmost room (i.e the room that has a center, which is the leftmost related to other rooms).
